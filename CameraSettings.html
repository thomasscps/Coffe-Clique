 <h2>Different Modes</h2>
 
	<ul>

    <p><strong>Automatic Mode</strong></p>
    <li>The camera does all of the work for you without you having to adjust anything.</li>
    <li>Great for beginners or when you need to take a photo quickly.</li>
	<p><strong>Aperture Priority Mode</strong></p>
    <li>You can adjust your F-Stop value while the camera adjusts ISO and Shutter Speed.</li>
    <li>Best used when you want to just control your depth or field.</li>
    <p><strong>Shutter Priority Mode</strong></p>
    <li>You can adjust your shutter speed and the camera adjusts ISO and Aperture for you.</li>
    <li>Best used when you want to control the speed you are shooting something at.</li>
    <p><strong>Landscape Mode</strong></p>
    <li>Uses a narrower aperture so you can capture the largest depth of field.</li>
    <li>Best used for taking pictures of scenery.</li>
	<p><strong>Portrait Mode</strong></p>
    <li>Sets a wide aperture to just make your subject in focus.</li>
    <li>Best used when taking headshots or photos of a person as your subject.</li>
    <p><strong>Night Mode</strong></p>
    <li>Increases your ISO and slows Shutter Speed.</li>
    <li>Used to capture dimly lit scenes or shooting at night.</li>
    <p><strong>Manual Mode</strong></p>
    <li>You have full control of all the settings.</li>
    <li>Best used for having full control of the image produced.  Trade off is that it is more difficult to shoot in this mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

<h3>Manual Settings</h3>
	<ul>
    <p><strong>ISO</strong></p>
    <li>ISO controls how sensitive the camera is to light.</li>
    <li>The higher the ISO the more sensitive the camera will be to light.  Typically want to do this with less lighting but it introduces a lot of noise.</li>
    <li>The lower the ISO the less sensitive your camera is to light and you get less grain in your image.</li>
    <li>Typically you see recommendations to keep your ISO to around 100-125 and not raise it to high.</li>
    <p><strong>F Stop or Aperture</strong></p>
    <li>Aperture or more commonly referred to as F-Stop is the setting that controls how much light you let through the lens.</li>
    <li>The more narrow your aperture the less amount of light you let in.  You get a sharper background and a deeper depth of field.  The higher the F-Stop value the narrower you get.</li>
    <li>The wider your aperture the more light you let in.  You get a shallower depth of field and a blurred background.  The lower the F-Stop value the wider the aperature is.</li>
    <p><strong>Shutter Speed</strong></p>
    <li>Shutter speed controls how long your shutter stays open allowing light to come in.</li>
    <li>A slow shutter speed lets in more light and captures a lot of motion blur.  A slower speed is anything more than 1 second.</li>
    <li>A faster shutter speed lets in less light and freezes motion.  A faster speed is anything over 1/1000 of a second.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Here is a great reference video that goes into more depth of those settings.</h2>
